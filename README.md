Qlik Sense SaaS Monitoring App

This is the very first version of a monitoring app for Qlik Sense SaaS. Currently it loads a basic set of information via the APIs:
* Events
* Items (Apps)
* Reloads (more detailed than the associated events)
* Users
* Spaces

It does some incremental loading but for now you have to manage this semi-manually.

More documentation to follow!
